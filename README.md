# Bounding and Approximating Intersectional Fairness through Marginal Fairness

This is the code used to conduct the experiments in https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05828.

Note that while we provide here the predictions in a separate file and the subsets of protected attributes used for our experiments, this code can be used for different predictions and subset of protected attributes, but it is possible that the amount of data will be insufficient.
The relevant code used to compute the subsets of protected attributes that have enough samples for some given predictions is also included, and only need to be uncommented. 

For any questions or concerns, please contact mathieu.b.molina@gmail.com or mathieu.molina@inria.fr.
